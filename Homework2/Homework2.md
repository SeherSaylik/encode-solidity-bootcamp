## Homework 2

Team discussion

1.Imagine you are designing a blockchain system

What behaviour / aspects of the system do you want to encourage ?

    I would want to encourage speed, transparency, security, governance and developers to deploy their applications on my network.

What behaviour / aspects of the system do you want to discourage ?

    Preventing selfish mining behavior, attacks and expensiveness would be the main topics. To prevent vulnerabilities, I believe nodes should be managed. With the awareness of nodes, we could detect the pre-attack stage to prevent the implantation of mining programs, thereby detecting selfish mining behavior and eliminating them permanently.

How have these behaviours been incentivised in Bitcoin ?

    Bitcoin doesn’t have an governance system but when we look from the other aspects, it provides a fully transparent distributed ledger means that all the transactions are viewable.

    Bitcoin also provides smart contract support, but it does not have a functionality as strong as Ethereum. This may result in less use of the network.

Are 51% attacks possible in Proof of Stake ?

    Yes, it’s possible. Malicious people who has the 51% of staked ETH can change a transaction data or can cause double spending. However this is more risky for the malicious person/people because they will have a possibility to lose their 51% staked ETH worth crypto.
