# Homework 7

Using truffle or hardhat

1. Create a project for your Volcano coin
2. Write unit tests for your Volcano coin contract
   The tests should show that
   1. The total supply is initially 10000
   2. That the total supply can be increased in 1000 token steps
   3. Only the owner of the contract can increase the supply.
